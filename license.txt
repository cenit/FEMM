Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 
Aladdin Enterprises,Menlo Park, California, U.S.A.
All rights reserved. 

NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU
Licenses published by the Free Software Foundation.
Its terms are substantially different from those of
the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU
Licenses, please read this license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the
permission to apply this License to their own work,
as long as the entire License (including the above
notices and this paragraph) is copied with no
changes, additions, or deletions except for changing
the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a
suitable description of the work to which the
license is being applied and of the person or entity
that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the
License is being applied to a work created in a
country other than the United States, replacing the
first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate
reference to the laws of the appropriate country.

0. Subject Matter

This License applies to the computer program known
as "Finite Element Method Magnetics." The "Program",
below, refers to such program. The Program is a
copyrighted work whose copyright is held by David C.
Meeker of Natick, MA, dmeeker@ieee.org (the 
"Licensor"). Please note that the program Triangle, 
written by Jonathan Shewchuk and used by FEMM
for the purposes of mesh generation is NOT covered
by this license and is subject to its own licensure terms. 
The licensure terms for Triangle are attached after
this license.  The Lua scripting language used by
FEMM is also distributed under its own licensing
terms.  The licensing terms of Lua are also attached.

A "work based on the Program" means either the
Program or any derivative work of the Program, as
defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976,
such as a translation or a modification.

BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY
WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR
MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING
OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO
MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE
WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW.  IF YOU
DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT
MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.

Licensor hereby grants you the following rights,
provided that you comply with all of the
restrictions set forth in this License and provided,
further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of
this License with the Program:

(a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e.,
verbatim) copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it throughout the world, in any medium.

(b) You may modify the Program, create works based
on the Program and distribute copies of such
throughout the world, in any medium.

2. Restrictions.

This license is subject to the following restrictions:

(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on
the Program by a commercial organization to any
third party is prohibited if any payment is made in
connection with such distribution, whether directly
(as in payment for a copy of the Program) or
indirectly (as in payment for some service related
to the Program, or payment for some product or
service that includes a copy of the Program "without
charge"; these are only examples, and not an
exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities).
The following methods of distribution involving
payment shall not in and of themselves be a
violation of this restriction:

(i)  Posting the Program on a public access
     information storage and retrieval service for
     which a fee is received for retrieving
     information (such as an on-line service),
     provided that the fee is not content- dependent
     (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving
     the same volume of information consisting of
     random data) and that access to the service and
     to the Program is available independent of any
     other product or service.  An example of a
     service that does not fall under this section
     is an on-line service that is operated by a
     company and that is only available to customers
     of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
     enumeration.)

(ii) Distributing the Program on removable
     computer-readable media, provided that the
     files containing the Program are reproduced
     entirely and verbatim on such media, that all
     information on such media be redistributable
     for non-commercial purposes without charge, and
     that such media are distributed by themselves
     (except for accompanying documentation)
     independent of any other product or service.
     Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic
     tape, and optical storage media. (This is not
     intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example
     of a distribution that does not fall under this
     section is a CD-ROM included in a book or
     magazine. (This is not an exhaustive
     enumeration.)

(b) Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification of the Program are not subject to this
License and they are outside its scope. Functional
use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and
any output produced through the use of the Program
is subject to this license only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of having been made by running the Program).

(c) You must meet all of the following conditions
with respect to any work that you distribute or
publish that in whole or in part contains or is
derived from the Program or any part thereof ("the
Work"):
 
(i)  If you have modified the Program, you must cause
     the Work to carry prominent notices stating
     that you have modified the Program's files and
     the date of any change.  In each source file
     that you have modified, you must include a
     prominent notice that you have modified the
     file, including your name, your e-mail address
     (if any), and the date and purpose of the
     change;

(ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a
     whole and at no charge to all third parties
     under the terms of this License;

(iii) If the Work normally reads commands
     interactively when run, you must cause it, at
     each time the Work commences operation, to
     print or display an announcement including an
     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that
     there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
     provide a warranty). Such notice must also
     state that users may redistribute the Work only
     under the conditions of this License and tell
     the user how to view the copy of this License
     included with the Work.  (Exceptions: if the
     Program is interactive but normally prints or
     displays such an announcement only at the
     request of a user, such as in an "About box",
     the Work is required to print or display the
     notice only under the same circumstances; if
     the Program itself is interactive but does not
     normally print such an announcement, the Work
     is not required to print an announcement.);

(iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete
     corresponding machine-readable source code,
     delivered on a medium customarily used for
     software interchange.  The source code for a
     work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it. For an executable
     work, complete source code means all the source
     code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the
     scripts used to control compilation and
     installation of the executable code. If you
     distribute with the Work any component that is
     normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components
     (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
     system on which the executable runs, you must
     also distribute the source code of that
     component if you have it and are allowed to do
     so;

(v)  If you distribute any written or printed
     material at all with the Work, such material
     must include either a written copy of this
     License, or a prominent written indication that
     the Work is covered by this License and written
     instructions for printing and/or displaying the
     copy of the License on the distribution medium;

(vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on
     the recipient's exercise of the rights granted
     herein.  If distribution of executable or
     object code is made by offering the equivalent
     ability to copy from a designated place, then
     offering equivalent ability to copy the source
     code from the same place counts as distribution
     of the source code, even though third parties
     are not compelled to copy the source code along
     with the object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as
expressly set forth herein. You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries for any reason,
Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.

5. Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT
WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER
PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

6. General.

This License is governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., excluding
choice of law rules.

If any part of this License is found to be in
conflict with the law, that part shall be
interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with
the law, and no other parts of the License shall be
affected.

For United States Government users, the Program is
provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  If you are a unit
or agency of the United States Government or are
acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,
the following apply:

If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense
("DOD"), the Program and its documentation are
classified as "commercial computer software" and
"commercial computer software documentation"
respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202,
the Government is acquiring the Program and its
documentation in accordance with the terms of this
License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD,
the Program and its documentation are classified as
"commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation" respectively and,
pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is
acquiring the Program and its documentation in
accordance with the terms of this License.

Triangle
A Two-Dimensional Quality Mesh Generator
and Delaunay Triangulator.
Version 1.3

Copyright 1996 Jonathan Richard Shewchuk
School of Computer Science

5000 Forbes Avenue
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  15213-3891
Please send bugs and comments to jrs@cs.cmu.edu

Created as part of the Archimedes project (tools for
parallel FEM).  Supported in part by NSF Grant
CMS-9318163 and an NSERC 1967 Scholarship.  There is
no warranty whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations,
constrained Delaunay triangulations, and quality
conforming Delaunay triangulations.  The latter can
be generated with no small angles, and are thus
suitable for finite element analysis. 

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle,
including complete references, can be found in the
comments at the beginning of the triangle.c source
file.  Another listing of these references, with
PostScript copies of some of the papers, is available
from the Web page

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.research.html

[Triangle] may be freely redistributed under the
condition that the copyright notices (including the
copy of this notice in the code comments and the
copyright notice printed when the `-h' switch is
selected) are not removed, and no compensation is
received.  Private, research, and institutional use
is free.  You may distribute modified versions of
this code UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THIS CODE AND ANY
MODIFICATIONS MADE TO IT IN THE SAME FILE REMAIN
UNDER COPYRIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR, BOTH SOURCE
AND OBJECT CODE ARE MADE FREELY AVAILABLE WITHOUT
CHARGE, AND CLEAR NOTICE IS GIVEN OF THE
MODIFICATIONS.  Distribution of this code as part of
a commercial system is permissible ONLY BY DIRECT
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR.  (If you are not
directly supplying this code to a customer, and you
are instead telling them how they can obtain it for
free, then you are not required to make any
arrangement with [JRS].)

If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to
accomplish real work, I would like very much to hear
from you.  A short letter or email (to
jrs@cs.cmu.edu) describing how you use Triangle will
mean a lot to me.  The more people I know are using
this program, the more easily I can justify spending
time on improvements and on the three-dimensional
successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit
you.  Also, I can put you on a list to receive email
whenever a new version of Triangle is available.

If you use a mesh generated by Triangle, please
include an acknowledgment as well.
